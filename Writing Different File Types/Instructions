Introduction

Developers often find themselves on projects that require creating text and binary files to store various kinds of data.
This can prove challenging because text and binary files require specific classes and methods to read, write, and manage the data effectively.

Remember

So far, youâ€™ve learned about the importance of files in Java and how to write and read text and binary files using
character and binary streams. As you work through this lab, remember a text file contains human-readable characters, 
typically encoded in formats like ASCII or UTF-8, and usually has a .txt extension. In contrast, a binary file stores 
non-human-readable data as byte sequences (like images, videos, or programs) and cannot be viewed with a text editor.

In this lab, you'll follow a series of steps to practice writing text and binary files using different approaches. 
These exercises will equip you to handle various file operations in future projects, like logging application events in a text file or storing encrypted data in a binary format.

Goal

Create and manipulate text and binary files to store various types of data, such as string representations of objects and numerical values.
