Update the existing Tiger, Penguin, and Dolphin classes to make them serializable, enabling their state to be saved to a file. Then, you'll override the toString() method in each class, allowing you to display the deserialized data on the screen after reading it from the file.

You'll then write methods to save each animal's data into separate filesâ€”one for the tiger, one for the Penguin, and one for the Dolphin. After that, you'll create a method to retrieve and display this data from the files, ensuring that the saved information can be easily accessed.

Finally, you'll add two new options to the main menu: one to save all the animal data to their respective files, and another to retrieve and display the data from those files, making the program more interactive and user-friendly.
