Amelia runs a small local bookstore. Lucas, on the other hand, has set up an online business selling first-edition copies of classic fiction titles.
For both of them, tracking the books that they have in stock is vital to their business success.
Amelia and Lucas are possible future customers for an application you are helping to develop called My Books Management System.

The My Books Management System currently comprises a directory named myBooks that contains a collection of sample files representing individual books.
In this lab, you will demonstrate your ability to handle various file and directory operations in 
Java by managing file systems within the My Books Management System. The tasks you are asked to do, such as creating directories, renaming,
copying or deleting files, and implementing methods to serialize and deserialize a book object, are common file handling and directory tasks you 
might encounter in real-world software development.

Goal

Your goal is to implement efficient file system management in the My Books Management System.
You will manage directories in Java by performing a series of file and directory operations 
each of which is critical for efficient file system management. 
Requirements

    Read all files available in the directory and list them in the console. This will be used to print all book files.

    Create a new directory in the system. This directory will store backup copies of your book files. 

    Rename files to correct any naming errors or to change the directory or file name.

    Copy files from one directory to another. This task will test your ability to duplicate files effectively,
including handling file copying operations and potential errors.

    Delete specific files from a directory. This shows your ability to manage file lifecycle, including 
removing unnecessary or obsolete files, which is crucial for maintaining an efficient and clean file system.

Implement methods to serialize a Book object to a file and deserialize it back into an object. 
Object persistence is a key concept for saving and restoring object states, which is essential for data storage and retrieval in real-world applications.
